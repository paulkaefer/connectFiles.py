connectFiles.py
===============

connect two files side-by-side

This script "glues" two files together. 
run like so:

    python connectFiles.py leftFile rightFile outputFile

Spaces will be added so the length of the lines in leftFile are all the same.

The bottoms of the files will line up in outputFile.
